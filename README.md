This is a final version of dance floor mania, an interactive game of dancing. The basic mechanic of the game is that will appear different arrows for two players,
every arrow that a player destroys it will give him 100 points, after a while will appear cooperative arrows, that both players have to collide to destroy and 
earn points. Finally, the player that first strikes 2450 points will win.
